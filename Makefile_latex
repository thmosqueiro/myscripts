#
# Simple Makefile for LaTeX projects
# Suggestions (pull requests) are welcome!!
# 
# 
# Simple example: suppose you want to compile the file paper.tex, then run
#
# make f=paper
# 
# Remember to drop the file extension (.tex, .aux, etc).
# 
# The 'complete' target means you want a complete cycle of 2
# compilations, one call to bibtex, then two additional
# compilations. Afterwards, clean will also be called. You can define
# how it will be compiled. For instance, to compile with pdflatex:
# 
# make complete m=pdf f=paper
# 
# Old school people usually compile using a combo of latex, dvi2ps and
# ps2pdf. You can achieve that by using oldschool target.
# 
# make oldschool f=paper
# 
# This will compile with pdflatex, then use bibtex, and recompile-it with
# pdflatex. You can also set $f=paper in the beginning of the script if
# you don't wat to keep writing f=paper.
