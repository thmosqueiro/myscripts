# Simple Makefile for LaTeX projects
# Suggestions (pull requests) are welcome!!
# 
# 
# Simple example: suppose you want to compile the file paper.tex, then run
#
# make f=paper
# 
# Remember to drop the file extension (.tex, .aux, etc).
# This will compile with pdflatex, then use bibtex, and recompile-it with
# pdflatex. You can also set $f=paper in the beginning of the script if
# you don't wat to keep writing f=paper.
